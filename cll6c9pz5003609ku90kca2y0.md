## [AI flies a big-ass military drone](https://www.defensenews.com/unmanned/2023/08/03/artificial-intelligence-flies-xq-58a-valkyrie-drone)

(I like big drones and I cannot lie)

* Nothing particular on the algo: `Autonomous Air Combat Operations team created algorithms for the flight that took millions of hours to mature in simulations`
    
* Deployed a [semi-autonomous traffic control system](https://afresearchlab.com/news/afwerx-integrates-uncrewed-traffic-management-to-enhance-safety-and-security/) in late June (Capt. Terrence McKenna!)

![Pathogenic mechanisms proposed for MDD. MAOA VNTR polymorphism increases MAOA expression, decreases 5-HT and affects the prenatal development of brain architecture and circuits, leading to impaired adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Polymorphisms of 5-HTRs and 5-HTTs, and BDNF deficiency and polymorphism are associated with the depressive behaviors in the adulthood. Chronic stress causes HPA dysfunction and increases glucocorticoid, resulting in the neuronal loss and the volume atrophy in the hippocampus](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315058913/figure/fig1/AS:960314417877042@1605968207870/Pathogenic-mechanisms-proposed-for-MDD-MAOA-VNTR-polymorphism-increases-MAOA-expression.gif align="center")

A not-so-brand-spanking-new **prescriber's guide**.

* MAOIs remain a valuable tool in treating atypical depression (not only, though)
    
* Which, as we remember, is linked to [hypoactivation of HPA axis](https://baldr.medium.com/%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC-%D0%B8-%D0%B3%D0%B3%D0%BD-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%81%D1%8F-%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C-%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B7-45dcf8a9d1c4):
    
* [chronic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10658922/) MAOIs [activate HPA](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/146/3/1338/2500719), and I shit you not - it's a [two-way feedback loop](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016517819290064A): *HPA hyperactivation promotes MAO activity, and vice versa*
    

# [Anatomy of a research paper](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7094980347829895168/)

A nice **cognitive framework** not only for research, but for approaching almost any complex problem/task. Kind of a separate case of [DBT acronym skills](https://dbtselfhelp.com/dbt-skills-list/miscellaneous/dbt-encyclopedia/), but for thinking!

![Anatomy of a research paper](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFatUczS7XUtA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1691575131895?e=1694649600&v=beta&t=Exq1V2ANF4Rx7-3W_Ey5aKO0hCxDS8vSyFTFBRBqc1o align="center")

## [Cognition ‚áî Computation ‚áî ML?](https://psyarxiv.com/4cbuv/) Nah.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691742000219/9ce7210a-3208-4d39-8d2f-115eb93f45fc.png align="center")

The authors ponder on several topics:

* Stop trying to create human-level AI using machine learning, it's largely intractable
    
* Human cognition is a form of computation? And more, one that can be replicated in a machine? Not so fast, Dorothy
    
* The authors also show that the products of AI-as-engineering are **not genuine or accurate models** of human cognition, but rather decoys that induce distorted and impoverished images of ourselves and our thinking
    
* AI can provide useful computational tools (such as frameworks, concepts, formalisms, models, proofs, simulations, etc.) that **support theory building and testing** in cognitive science, but only used with care
    
* **Computationalism** (the idea that cognition is a form of computation) can be informative for cognitive science, but it does not imply **computerism** (the idea that cognition can be realised in machines)
    

## [Free limited LLM API access](https://chimeragpt.adventblocks.cc) by ChimeraGPT

Using it for testing (and (shitty) reposts).

## [Elliptical curve cryptography visualization](https://curves.xargs.org)

Again, reminding of [awesome explorable explanations](https://github.com/blob42/awesome-explorables)!

P.S. TFW you postpone writing to do longer posts to find out you put out almost none ü•≤

P.P.S. *The Aboriginals had always used* ***boomerangs***\*. Do the Aboriginals born after 2000 use\* ***zoomerangs***\*?\* ü§î
