**Next episode:** DMT MoA, vector knowledge hippocampus (it's not a metalcore band, I promise!) and mental models I've long mentioned.

# Pack your cow reactors, Billy!

Okay, let's start without a prelude (not that I advise that - on the contrary <s>oh shut up at long last</s>), here's a more readable and concise [summary of technologies Agtech VCs look into investing](https://foodhack.global/articles/Top-food-and-climate-investors) ⇒ I'd view this as an **~informed view of trends to come and overall vertical future directions**:

# Linkies-twinkies

## Single mingle

![](https://i.imgur.com/mbMJX1v.png align="center")

Being forever alone may not be THAT bad, [Bella DePaulo notes](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01gsa1h2cwykvsg68hkmhffjjx):

* Many single people are just as happy or happier than married or partnered people;
    
* Single people have the freedom to live life the way they want to and are often more integrated into their communities than married people;
    
* Single people also connect more with families, neighbors, and friends, and are more available to assist others;
    
* Singlehood satisfaction tends to increase after midlife. This goes in line with [overall life satisfaction rising after 40s](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness/happiness-over-the-lifespan)?
    

A nice quote: `“The dangerous part of some of these societal messages is that it makes it seem like romantic relationships are some kind of a quick fix,” he says. “It’s important to get right with yourself first—to develop emotional stability and build a life you’re happy with, consistent with your values. Otherwise, a romantic relationship is just a recipe to make two people miserable instead of one.”`

## [Optimizing complex systems](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01gkza3vqkp7s3hvk21t4wzm7j/)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*QbOCjktsTsre6HDf align="center")

**Stakeholders** are those with skin in the game. No, not the ones waiting to stake a vampire. And designing a system that satisfies all requirements stated is sometimes a daunting task. As with, say, relationships, it's a tight <s>uh oh</s> interplay of trade-offs and OMGs.

* One problem is that stakeholders hold different views on the system's goals - hence they may even describe the requirements in different ways, with no obvious method of normalizing that;
    
* A way to overcome the aforementioned problem is to describe the system's goals as metrics with thresholds/constraints;
    
* Another potential bummer is planning for [unintended consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences), or sometimes perverse consequences - ideally we've got to have several laws that make the system adaptable to those, but who cares?
    

## [Products that monetize](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01gwqcprje69hmjv8e58pd7ywp/)

![The Product Strategy Playbook from McKinsey Alum - Free PPT Templates](https://www.stratechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Product-value.png align="center")

[Zoe Chew](https://whizzoe.substack.com/)'s spewing gold, as usual - now on **value** categories a **product can deliver**:

**<mark>Functional Value</mark>**<mark>:</mark> Create practical benefits for users by incorporating relevant technical features into your product:

* **Speed:** Offer a faster way to accomplish a specific user’s goal
    
* **Performance:** Easy to use and user-friendly
    
* **Friction removal:** Reduce obstacles and unstuck the user’s journey
    
* **Technical benefits:** More accurate and secure
    

**<mark>Monetary Value</mark>**<mark>:</mark> Combine functional value with monetary value by helping customers save money, avoid losses, and increase savings:

* **Affordability:** Attract price-sensitive customers with high-quality products at affordable prices
    
* **Reduce expenses:** Eliminate middlemen, complex cost structures or hidden fees
    
* **Great savings:** Offer discounts for bulk purchases or long-term subscriptions
    
* **Loyalty program:** Offer point-based rewards, exclusive discounts, and perks to frequent customers
    

**<mark>Emotional Value</mark>**<mark>:</mark> Increase product value by creating strong pleasant experiences for customers. Consider how your product makes customers feel after they use it.

* **Reduce stress:** Simplify people’s lives by removing complexities
    
* **Reduce uncertainty:** Remove doubts by providing transparent detail about how your product or service works
    
* **Increase confidence:** Provide a guarantee or promise that your product will deliver the desired results
    
* **Remove fears:** Assure customers by addressing their concerns
    

**<mark>Social Value</mark>**<mark>:</mark> Fulfill a person’s social status or social needs by creating a sense of community around your product and providing additional support, guidance, and resources.

* **Belongings:** Create a sense of community around your product by building an engaged online community where users can connect with like-minded people.
    
* **Motivation:** Provide additional support, guidance and resources to help users when they are stuck.
    
* **Recognition:** Provide rewards or celebrations when they achieve certain milestones.
    

I'd put this right near [NFX's Network effects' manual](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-manual) on usefulness, and would strongly advise doing a checklistey list when designing a product.
