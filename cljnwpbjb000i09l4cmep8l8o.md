# [Mental models, 1/n](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01gpx47q5qvk3g9nfgcb3h4w61)

Okay, there are 40 of them, gotta start with something:

### [Baader-Meinhof phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), or Frequency Illusion

![CogBlog – A Cognitive Psychology Blog » That Band is Really Cool, But I  Swear It's Everywhere](https://web.colby.edu/cogblog/files/2018/04/tumblr_o601be5J161su40qeo1_500.jpg align="center")

Similar but contrary to [inattentional blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness): **you start seeing things you think of/search more often** **and think they're more common**. Hence [motivated perception](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/8/20706126/motivated-perception-psychology), [the Secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction_(New_Thought)), 'Why is everyone speaking my language here arrghh' etc etc.

P.S. One of the links I wanted to share is actually [Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/) - a nice visual way to ingest things 🙃

### [Ostrich effect](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/ostrich-effect)

![Ostrich Effect: Are You Avoiding Unpleasant Information? - TechTello](https://www.techtello.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ostrich-effect.png align="center")

<s>Didn't think there's an effect explaining my life.</s>

Anticipating discomfort is often worse than the discomfort itself, so we avoid it altogether. Goes amazingly in line with [*"Choose not to be harmed - and you won't be harmed"*](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1219460-choose-not-to-be-harmed-and-you-won-t-feel-harmed-don-t) by one of the stoicism OGs, Marcus Aurelius.

### [Nobel disease](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nobel_disease)

Looks like a subset of [Halo effect](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/halo-effect) bias, but double-sided:

* **Excelling in one field doesn't prevent you from being incompetent in others** ⇢ diverse feedback is crucial;
    
* **When assessing someone's opinion/theories, do not let their status in one field influence your feedback** ⇢ bullshit is always bullshit, being universal like love 🫀
    

### [Warnock's dilemma](https://blog.lenzg.net/2021/11/have-you-ever-heard-of-warnocks-dilemma/)

![How the Media Inspires Mass Shooters – Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/dailynews-slider.jpg?w=990 align="center")

Especially relevant in today's [attention economy](https://www.dentsu.com/attention-economy): **news are often that provocative and fishing for our emotions only because it's the only way to grasp but a tiny bit of our attention and time.**

We're spending our focus like we're some fucking businessmen. Okay, cute fat cats are good, and [cuteness is healthy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4956347/):

![41-pound cat named Skinny up for adoption in Texas (+video) - Deseret News](https://deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0cafdb6/2147483647/strip/false/crop/793x446+104+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FMJYSdti6t2cD6-GqH1Zf0sM-B6g%3D%2F0x0%3A1000x446%2F1000x446%2Ffilters%3Afocal%28500x223%3A501x224%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F18860050%2F990936.jpg align="left")

### [Google Scholar effect](https://guides.library.pdx.edu/HRMML/GoogleScholar)

![50 Funny Science Memes For The Brainiacs | THE ROCKLE](https://therockle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/im-something-of-a-scientist-myself-meme.jpg align="left")

It's basically the [Matthew effect](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.159.3810.56) and [Filter Bubble](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/filter-bubble) combined:

* [Google Scholar ranks articles not in the least by their citation count](https://isg.beel.org/pubs/Google%20Scholar's%20Ranking%20Algorithm%20-%20The%20Impact%20of%20Articles'%20Age%20(An%20Empirical%20Study)%20--%20preprint.pdf) ⇢ **cited articles are more likely to get cited again**, powered by [Lindy effect](https://www.wealest.com/articles/lindy-effect) inverse: the more something is cited, the longer it will live as a [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) of information;
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1688446530426/0bb117aa-227f-4967-8798-71c1209dcf7d.png align="center")
    
* **Highly-cited articles prevent the less cited/maybe ones expressing other opinions to surface**, making science a bit, may I say, prone to recursion <s>circle-jerking</s>?
    

Just to think of: <mark>Google Scholar effect combined with Nobel disease can bring harmful consequences to the world's scientific knowledge and progress</mark>.

# Migraine

### MoA

Migraine is a bitch, there's no arguing that. Some of the latest theoretical mechanisms is [as follows](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpain.2021.705276/full):

* **Potential and optional**: a wave of so-called [Cortical Spreading Depression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cortical-spreading-depression) causes excitation in response to stimuli or triggers, then is changed by inhibition of neurons in the cortex. This may cause the migraine aura.
    

![CGRP-receptor antagonism in migraine treatment - The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2000996446/2003694480/gr1.jpg align="center")

* TRPV1 receptors are expressed more in chronic sufferers' scalp arteries and may promote activation of the trigeminovascular pathway pictured below. This pathway may be one of the main [pain-signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminovascular_system) ones. Fun fact: [TRPA1 receptors can, too, be used to promote headaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbellulone)!
    
    ![Trigeminovascular System - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780123851574010873-f01087-01-9780123851574.jpg align="center")
    
* TRPV receptors also promote the release of [CGRP](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.01249/full) (potent vasodilator ⇒ it opens/dilates blood vessels on the scalp) and [Substance P](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554583) (just a transmitter of pain, simple as that). Other peptides suspected to be in action are [VIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide) (lowers pressure and dilates blood vessels) and [pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00114/full) (causes mast cell degranulation/activation and vasodilation).
    
* CGRP and Substance P both signal pain and can lead to Central Sensitization, a state of heightened pain sensitivity due to repeated trigeminal pathway activation and inflammation.
    

### Potential drug MoAs

* **5HT1B/D agonism**: potentially inhibit the release of CGRP. There's a wide family of so-called [triptans with that MoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptan).
    
    ![Mechanisms of action of antimigraine treatments used in chronic... |  Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335510677/figure/fig1/AS:797805744513024@1567223120284/Mechanisms-of-action-of-antimigraine-treatments-used-in-chronic-migraine-and-emerging.png align="left")
    
* **5HT1F agonism**: also modulates CGRP release with less risk of vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). The newly approved brand-spankin'-new 5HT1F agonist is...[lasmitidan](https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-020-01132-3)!
    
* **CGRP receptor/peptide antibodies**: fremanezumab, galcanezumab and eptinezumab target the CGRP itself, while erenumab targets the CGRP receptor.
    
* **PACAP-38 antibodies**: another peptide promoting migraines. There was a trial of [PAC1 (receptor for PACAP-38) monoclonal antibody](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786389/), AMG-301, where it didn't show any benefit compared to placebo.
    
* [Onabotulinumtoxin-A](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34477213/) is a multi-modal chronic pain inhibitor:
    
    ![Toxins | Free Full-Text | Mechanisms of Botulinum Toxin Type A Action on  Pain](https://www.mdpi.com/toxins/toxins-11-00459/article_deploy/html/images/toxins-11-00459-g001.png align="left")
    
* **Trigeminal pathway inhibition** via numerous mechanisms: [topiramate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17300356/) + *I suspect other calcium channel blockers able to cross BBB (blood-brain barrier) to be effective?*
    
* Just **random thoughts**: substance P antagonists? However, they [didn't show any benefit](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11281817).
    
* **Non-pharm interventions**: American Headache Society proposes that [stimulation of sphenopalatine region nerves promotes significant relief in migraines](https://americanheadachesociety.org/news/new-investigational-treatments-findings-on-migraine-highlight-therapeutic-advancements/). They also mention that there's only *one migraine specialist per 65,000 sufferers* - both a pity and an opportunity 🫣

# Linkies

## A [disruptive product per year](https://twitter.com/aakashg0/status/1670656557183541249)

...by Aakash Gupta, since 1977!

## [KG and NaLLM](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01h3wtp1n07vag1raqhahnmhmn)

Combining knowledge graphs, text and vectors is the heat for causal reasoning with LLMs. Neo4j is exploring that with their [NaLLM](https://github.com/neo4j/NaLLM).

## [Warpdrive and faster multi-agent RL](https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/warpdrive-fast-rl-on-a-gpu/)

Heyy, let's just transfer all the needed data into a GPU, then create CUDA blocks for environments and simulate each agent in a separate thread? Yay, releasing [Warpdrive](https://github.com/salesforce/warp-drive) (looks actually pretty interesting for MARL)

## [Twitter community growth](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-to-build-a-community-on-twitter-5f0d0fc57e)

Some semi-obvious advice from Indie Hackers:

* Identify **low hanging fruit** - the audience that loves your content. Return with <s>a rage</s> better content;
    
* Check for **hashtags** that did well ⇢ use them;
    
* Grow **engagement**, be alive: comment, like, retweet, list etc;
    
* Start **connecting with people in active communities** you join;
    
* If returning, do an *"I'm back"*, then *"New content"* campaigns;
    
* **Cross-post** and **cross-share** your profiles and content where applicable and permitted.
    

## [Tax liens](https://alts.co/investing-in-tax-liens/)

![](https://alts.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-55-1024x746.jpeg align="left")

A noice **potential way to invest** given you're in the know and ready to diversify:

* Owner unable to pay property tax ⇢ it's now in tax lien issued by the government;
    
* The investor pays it off ⇢ awaits return + interest from the owner;
    
* In the case of non-payment, investor has the right to redeem the property.
    

### Risks

* **Unknowns**: you may acquire a dangerous/toxic land;
    
* **Tenants/neighborhood**: [What you say about my mama ? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y21r6jrNDJM), self-explanatory;
    
* **Dilapidated** (Love that word. It's like "She wants the D" ⇢ someone dilapidated and barely alive) properties.
