# Bifurcation, charts and communities

## What's one thing that describes the current world?

Cascading <s>fucking</s> [bifurcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-doubling_bifurcation).

We're approaching <mark>rising complexity and unpredictability</mark>, with the period to next "woah" decreasing and the amplitude of change - rising.

So it seems exactly the time to [integrate OODA loop](https://t.me/ohmyboi/686) in our lives and iterate over it faster. Startup culture [had already adopted it](https://blog.southparkcommons.com/move-fast-or-die/), and we can see the same mile-long advances in AI.

The <mark>real question</mark> stays the same: what will happen when the **iteration period itself reduces** to unintelligibly low values? As Hegel mentioned, a rise in quantity to its limit is followed by a [**qualitative leap**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/qualitative_leap). Basically, a **rise in abstraction level** in both research, progress, life and interaction?

Okay, one way to find out: adapt and <s>scream running in circles</s> üß¨ Apart from the usual *AI interaction engineers* I can see the profession of, I dunno, *complexity/ambiguity therapists* emerging, maybe? **Not all of us are okay** with things changing at an increasing pace, and we shouldn't be - we were made for slower times, for a bit more certainty, order and non-overloading information streams.

## Charts charts charts

So, we're venturing into complex systems and emergence. One way to deal with them is charting them on some landscape. Sooo...

A nice text-to-graph website: [Flowchart Fun](https://flowchart.fun/). Looks really fun:

[Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com/) is a mapping and development environment built in Pharo, a dialect of Smalltalk. Looking like everything and the kitchen sink, but the thing that interested me is the inbuilt Wardley mapping. May be of some use to someone.

## Usefulness & bonus links

* An awesome write-up on how to register [Stripe in unsupported countries](https://www.giveforms.com/support-article/using-stripe-in-unsupported-countries). Spoiler: you'll have to use [Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/zakhark3) <s>with a shameless reflink, they'll kick me out anyway</s> (or maybe another neo-bank providing international bank accounts, such as [Zen](https://www.zen.com/). Careful about this one, as their, say, *"1 virtual card free"* \= *"1 virtual card in the lifetime of your account, then plz shell out 5 EUR"*)
    

* A curated [index of communities](https://thehiveindex.com/). Well, just as it says - anything from founders to medicine, marketing, gamers and [cereal meditators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380174).
    
* Free [background](https://vackground.com/category/freebies) packs. Oh, and a [generator, BGJar](https://bgjar.com/).
