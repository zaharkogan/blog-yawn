# Moore's perspective

So I've stumbled upon an [article mentioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_cluster) that the most powerful supercomputer in 2010 was [Tianhe-1 with a peak performance of 2.5 petaFLOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianhe-1).

Fast forward, it's 2023. We've got [Graphcore IPUs available for free](https://console.paperspace.com/signup?R=SP8I2F) (ref link so I'll use it for paid plans...) at [Paperspace](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/machines/#free-machines-tier-list).

And they've got... **1 petaFLOPS with FP16** ([half-precision floating point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format)):

Okay, okay, Tianhe-1 has 2.56 on FP32, with the free IPU having just 0.25... But just think about it: **13 years** had passed, and we've got <mark>10% of the world's most powerful computing unit power</mark>, costing $20M/year in operating expenses and serviced by 200 people worth of staff, <mark>for free</mark>. And it weighs [about 16.5 kgs](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/bow-pod16#product-spec) instead of a datacenter-level size.
