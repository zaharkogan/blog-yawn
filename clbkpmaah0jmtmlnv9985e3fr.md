[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) uses ChatGPT + Bing search to, it seems, summarize a request & provide relevant sources. *It can't use all the ChatGPT's power*, so it's not like you can use Kanye's tweets to write a medieval poem, yet still pretty good for answering - kinda like [Elicit](https://elicit.org), but general-purpose.

Why isn't it called ShakesPeAI is out of my comprehension, yet [here it is](https://github.com/deepmind/dramatron).

Backpropagation ded: only forward (and again)! [Forward-forward propagation is proposed](https://twitter.com/martin_gorner/status/1599755684941557761) for self-supervised learning.
