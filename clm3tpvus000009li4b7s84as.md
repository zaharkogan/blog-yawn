You know what happens in cold water? Everything shrinks.

> [Bing's market share hasn't grown at all.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bings-search-market-share-fails-to-budge-despite-ai-push/) Bing's share of search It's still stuck at a lousy 3%.

So [did traffic to ChatGPT](https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/chatgpt-traffic-drops/) and other LLMs. What could be the possible reasons?

* People realize it's **no magic bullet** - rather prone to hallucinations etc. All this despite OpenAI and OSS pushing out things like [AI agents](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents), [interactive fiction](https://github.com/mluogh/eastworld) and [multimodal models for healthcare](https://sites.research.google/med-palm/)
    
* Again, a realization the **AI revolution won't take weeks, but months/years, if at all**. Despite that, people are losing jobs and [engaging in so-called 'sweatshops'](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/28/scale-ai-remotasks-philippines-artificial-intelligence/) - often it's the only possible income source. Yet still they are faced with platform bans, below-minimum-wage payouts and exploitation. It's a social issue I feel deserves outcrying.
    
* Personally, I see it as a combination of trying to hastily **pump out deterministic outputs from a non-deterministic system** + a **one-armed bandit we're relentlessly pushing** the lever of, because each time we're getting an output which is approximately needed and plausible - yet all the time it's not the jackpot
    
    ![AI AI AI AI… AI!](https://i.imgur.com/yeN6RRV.jpg align="left")
    
    AI AI AI AI… AI!
    
* AI raises and faces **legal**, **regulatory**, and **public** challenges - everyone's suddenly afraid of big corp using his/her personal data, scamming, yada yada. However, AI seems to excel (thanks to open source!) at deception, citing:
    
    * AI is now used in a series of [elaborate ransom scams](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/29/us/ai-scam-calls-kidnapping-cec/index.html).
        
    * New AI bots [create malware on demand](https://decrypt.co/150899/wormgpt-fraudgpt-ai-hackers-phishing-malware).
        
    * Cheap AI music is used to replace human songs—not because it's better, but [because it's cheaper, and puts more power in the hands of technocrat platforms](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/twelve-brutal-truths-about-ai-music).
        
    * Students are [cheating with the aid of AI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/18/ai-cheating-teaching-chatgpt-students-college-university).
        
    * AI threatens to [disrupt the 2024 election with fake videos](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ais-rapid-growth-threatens-to-flood-2024-campaigns-with-fake-videos-dbd8144f).
        
    * Publications are misleading readers, who get [served up AI articles with little disclosure](https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai).
        

So, consumer demand is shrinking; with companies adopting the useful parts - the ones allowing them to run cheaper, extract more revenue - the usual. Remind something?

[Hmmm…](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/gartner-blockchain-web3-hype-cycle/)

Yeah, too for me. Are there any ways forward/around/inside? I believe yeah, one possibility lying in reasoning.

Graphs + ML = ❤️

[SE(3) Diffusion](https://github.com/jasonkyuyim/se3_diffusion)

Some of the papers' topics:

* **New GNN architectures**: novel ideas of dynamically rewired message passing with delay and slow nodes for long-range tasks
    
* **Generative Models**: e.g. diffusion models for graph generation (think Stable Diffusion that makes graphs)
    
* **Molecules & proteins:** generating molecules, protein description (by its structure), predicting high resolution mass spectra (in 19 min instead of 126 hours - **x398 speedup**)
    
* **Knowledge:** knowledge graph embedding ('packing'), discovering [both **unseen entities** and **relations**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OoOpO0u4Xd)

A huge repository of IBM-developed neurosymbolic AI OSS, divided into 8 categories:

* Logical Neural Network (LNN)
    
* Natural language processing via reasoning (NLP)
    
* Knowledge foundation (KF)
    
* Learning with less (LwL)
    
* Knowledge augmented sequential decision making (SDM)
    
* Human in the loop (HIL)
    
* Datasets and environments (DS)
    
* Related advances (RA)
    

Plus a nice [taxonomy of neurosymbolic systems](https://harshakokel.com/posts/neurosymbolic-systems/), which I won't include for brevity.
